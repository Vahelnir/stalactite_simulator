# Java mini-project

This project was made at the end of the java course. It was developed by **Christophe O.** and **Valentin H.V.**.

## Cave & stalactite simulator

The goal was to simulate the generation of stalactites & stalagmites inside of a cave.

The current implementation only simulate the stalactite generation (on the ceiling), the floor as yet to be implemented.

## UI

The UI is pretty simple because we didn't have that much time to do better.

Colors:

- Water drops: blue
- "Soda straw" (hollowed stalactite): red
- Stalactite: yellow
